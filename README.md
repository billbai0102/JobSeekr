# JobSeeker
An advanced VR Job Simulator that I created with a team at HackTheNorth 2019. 36 hours of blood sweat and tears later, this is our final product. Enter any job listing link, and JobSeekr will create a simulation for you that speaks, receives your responses, and grades it.

## Technical Details

### Unity assets used

Tool-UnityAssetCleaner: deletes unused assets from package

Google VR SDK: provides Google VR support

POLYGON - City Pack: a low poly asset pack of characters, buildings, props, vehicles and environment assets to create a city based polygonal style game

Simple Office: a simple asset pack of office rooms and objects

Microsoft Azure Speech SDK: provides Azure speech to text and text to speech support

*Note: a sitting animation from Mixamo is used*

## Inspiration
We noticed that students from high schools and universities are now struggling with job interviews, so we decided to create a VR simulator to help them prepare for their interviews.

## How does JobSeekr work
JobSeekr provides a unique VR Job Simulation by using advanced algorithms paired with Microsoft's Azure services in order to scrape data from user requested job postings, and create unique questions relevant to the job.

## How we built JobSeekr
We built JobSeekr by splitting up the project into the front end VR and text tools, and the back end job posting scraping text analysis. We used python with JSON data for analyzing text, using Azure Cognitive Services Text Analysis, while on the front end we used Unity for VR as well as Azure Text to Speech and Speech to Text.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that our project can be able to influence others in a positive way by assisting them with their journey in obtaining their desired jobs, as well as easing their experience with public speaking.

## What's next for JobSeekr
Our team has planned the future direction of the project. We are going to integrate new technologies to improve current features. For example, adding machine learning to refine web scrapping results and generate more natural questions. Second, expanding the existing contents is also an area we focus on. We plan to add more scenarios such as coffee shops and small town scenes. They are aimed to create a relaxing environment for people to practice speaking confidently during interviews. Also, we are looking for more possibilities which can be implemented, such as deploy it into more platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or even a television.

## Final 
The python script to web scrape and apply Azure Text Analytics is Seperate from the Unity Folder (still included)
